# Baloons
Balloons is a game which you pop ballons on the screen by pressing on them. The balloons can overlap. If you pop two or more balloons when overlaping, you get points. The game continues for some time.

There is a jar file for the game and also the source files. Feel free to take a look at the code. Also, enjoy the game.
